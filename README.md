# Writing Efficient Python Code:

Here my personal notes from [the Writing Efficient Python Code course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-efficient-python-code#!)


_____


In this course, I'm learning how to use Python's built-in data structures, functions, and modules to write cleaner, faster, and more efficient code. Here I will explore how to time and profile code in order to find bottlenecks. Then, I will practice eliminating these bottlenecks, and other bad design patterns, using Python's Standard Library, NumPy, and pandas. After completing this course, I will have the necessary tools to start writing efficient Python code!
